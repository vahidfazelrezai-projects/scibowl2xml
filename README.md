## scibowl2xml
- Contains sets 1 and 2 from [here](http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/high-school/high-school-regionals/hs-rules-forms-resources/sample-science-bowl-questions/).
- Currently in XML with special HTML for special symbols (like superscripts, degree signs, etc.). Text were files created by copying from PDFs and editing.
- Future todos:
  - move to JSON
  - deal with special characters in a better way
  - add more questions
  - reorganize questions and establish a reference convention
